Break down
Make file:
- make sure there is a dir at /tmp/dsp187/mountdir
- run makefile
- run ./rufs -s /tmp/dsp187/mountdir
- to check if mounted: 
  - see if findmnt cmd has this line"
  - "│ └─/tmp/dsp187/mountdir                      rufs                                     fuse.rufs         rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=90443,group_id=1905221765"
- to unmount:
  - run fusermount -u /tmp/dsp187/mountdir
Questions:
- 

Block i/o layer:
- all implemented

Bitmap:
- implement get_avail_ino(), and get_avail_blkno()

Inode:
- readi
- writei

Directory and Namei:
- dir_find
- dir_add
- get_node_by_path

The start:
- rufs_mkfs()

File System handlers
- rufs_init
- rufs_destroy
- rufs_getattr

- rufs_opendir - cd
- rufs_readdir - ls
- rufs_mkdir - mkdir


- rufs_create - touch
- rufs_open
- rufs_read
- rufs_write



However we will say the following steps:
1. rufs_mkfs, rufs_init, and rufs_destroy should probably be the first place to start as you need a “disk”
to even start
2. You should probably implement all the helper functions as you will make good use of them when
implementing the rest of the rufs functions.
3. The bitmap operations are the easiest to implement
4. The inode helper operations (readi and writei) are the second easiest
5. The directory operations are the hardest one
6. Once you implement some of the helper functions, you can start using them within the rest of the rufs
functions you have to implement
